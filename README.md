# Memory Game Project

The Memory Game is made up of sixteen cards, which makes 8 pairs of cards. These cards are placed randomly on the card deck and are placed face down. The player can only see two cards at a time. If the cards match, the cards remain open, otherwise they are flipped face down again. The game is timed, and there are star ratings. The star rating depends on how many moves the player has made. When the player wins, a modal appears with the player's name, the time it took to win the game, and the star rating. The player has the option to restart the game any time they wish.
